    "Designing feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.\n",

    "**Enable Spatial access methods (SAMs)** to answer queries more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval of distances: although its more clear to know the similarity of two objects, but it may be computational difficult. And here comes the benefit of embedding at Euclidean space.\n",

    "- `query-by-example`, whether it's easy to embedding a new node into this space.\n",
